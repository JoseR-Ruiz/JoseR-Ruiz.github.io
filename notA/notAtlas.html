            <h2>Who is kollektiv orangotango?</h2>

            <p>
                kollektiv orangotango was founded in 2008. Since then it has been constantly developing 
                through a network of critical geographers, friends and activists who deal with questions 
                regarding space, power and resistance. With our geographical activism, we seek to support 
                processes and oppositional actors who instigate social change by prefiguring social 
                alternatives. We conduct emancipatory educational work as well as concrete political and 
                artistic interventions. These are supposed to enforce reflections on and changes of social 
                conditions. Through workshops, publications, mappings, excursions, and creative interventions 
                within public space, we collectively learn how to read space and how to initiate emancipatory 
                processes from below.
            </p>

            <p>
                So far we have engaged in the fields of right to the city, (urban) agriculture, critical 
                pedagogy, alternative housing and solidarity economy, mostly in Europe and also in Latin 
                America. But kollektiv orangotango also functions as a platform for different actions. In 
                the case of Not-an-Atlas, its publication was realized by kollektiv orangotango in 
                cooperation with other activists and academics. That is the reason why it was named 
                kollektiv orangotango+.
            </p>

            <p>
                All of this is happening through collective and self-organized practice. In other words: 

                <em>"We're going slow, because we're going far"!</em>
            </p>

            <h2>How to Edit and Reflect Counter-Cartographies Collectively as Activists and Academics?</h2>

            <p>
                Both our activist experiences with collective and critical mapping workshops as kollektiv 
                orangotango as well as our individual and academic engagements with maps served as starting 
                points for Not-an-Atlas. In the spring of 2015 we released a Call for Maps in English, 
                German and Spanish, inviting everyone engaged with practices of critical mapping to send us 
                ideas, texts, photos and, of course, maps. We were overwhelmed by the resonance!
            </p>

            <p>
                Nearly 150 submissions found their way to us. Some of them came from places, struggles and 
                activists we had not heard of before; others came from long-time companions and friends. 
                Among them were contributions from well-known critical cartographers, activists, and social 
                movements who have been working with maps for many years; but even more emerging mapmakers 
                sent us their proposals. What followed were exciting three years of discussing, selecting 
                and editing the various maps and projects.
            </p>

            <p>
                Again and again we had to ask ourselves: What actually makes a map (not) critical? And what 
                do we (not) have in mind when working on a counter-atlas? We also had to continually negotiate 
                between more activist and more academic modes of knowledge production.
            </p>

            <p>
                So we understand notanatlas.org as a continuation of the Not-an-Atlas book. Because we want 
                to continue to share maps, struggles, projects, texts and inspirations online.
            </p>
